Could make a general cache_search and cache_move function, with a param
that indicates the cache level (L1 vs L2). This is to handle writebacks.
If L1, we write back to L2 on dirty block eviction and move it to VC.
If L2, we write back to memory in this design (i.e. block can fall off
the face of the earth lol)

This makes it easy to implement L2, and VC is just modifying one function and
possibly adding another.

Could clean up parsing of command line args in main.rs based on advice.
