Cleanup L1 code
    - Possibly generalize cache access functions?
    - Stop using regex. It's slow

Implement VC

Implement L2
    - If generalized cache access functions, super easy.

Debug(?)

Cleanup all code
    - Modify Argument parsing by using a map function? CacheSystem::new() would
        need to take in a tuple then? I think that's alright.
